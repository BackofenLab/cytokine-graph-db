# AxoWise User Guide

## Overview
AxoWise is designed to help you develop contextual biological insights using protein interaction data, functional relationships, and literature-based knowledge extraction. It leverages multiple interconnected networks and advanced AI-driven techniques to provide meaningful insights.

### Networks in AxoWise
AxoWise integrates three key networks:
- **Protein Network**: Identifies and clusters protein communities based on interaction data, helping uncover functional modules.
- **Function Network**: Maps functional relationships between proteins to explore biological roles and interactions.
- **Publication Network**: Extracts relevant abstracts and knowledge from literature, linking biological concepts with scientific publications.

### Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG)
AxoWise employs **Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG)** to enhance biological insight extraction:
- **Graph Retrieval**: Retrieves structured biological knowledge from the integrated networks, ensuring context-aware data exploration.
- **Augmented Generation**: Uses AI-powered summarization and text generation to provide actionable insights, integrating findings from the protein, function, and publication networks into a cohesive narrative.
AxoWise is designed to help you develop contextual biological insights using protein interaction data, functional relationships, and literature-based knowledge extraction.
